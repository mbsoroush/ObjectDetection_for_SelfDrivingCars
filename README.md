# Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars using YOLO 🚗

This repository contains a project demonstrating object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The dataset includes images captured from car-mounted cameras in various driving conditions.

📌 Features
Uses YOLO for real-time object detection.
Processes images from an autonomous vehicle dataset.
Utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.
Helps in detecting objects like pedestrians, vehicles, and road signs for autonomous driving applications.
