# Object Detection for Self-Driving Cars using YOLO ðŸš—

This repository contains a project demonstrating object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The dataset includes images captured from car-mounted cameras in various driving conditions.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on my Kaggle page:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Car Camera Photos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbsoroush/car-camera-photos)

## ðŸ“Œ Features
-  Uses YOLO for real-time object detection.
-  Processes images from an autonomous vehicle dataset.
-  Utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.
-  Helps in detecting objects like pedestrians, vehicles, and road signs for autonomous driving applications.
